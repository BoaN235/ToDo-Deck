## 12/9/25
### 2-3 hours: I Finished the tutorial to create a dev board schematic and added all the foot prints. Now I have to figure out how I am going to add the screen and figure out what else I want to add to this.

I also found this [screen](https://www.amazon.com/Waveshare-7-5inch-Two-Color-Interface-Consumption/dp/B075R69T93/ref=sr_1_8?crid=1C4VNUN58CQ96&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HtY108VzBSVycvu9uNDxEA00i1BAcZNhFtlj5Q7-Vf6JW0AZZMQnDdcbT9YxeWFLIDqoiaC207o0qHzdA8hx96mJfVj9zCsyt8iQ7FrNc6o_-pO-Xg2RucrXoshhU_hGpNyS8lqyzNA-Mig202ZrkVuP0syMqXrY4Adg4lX_Y0cjgarSey7a2W2K5W7gmoJo3otpKXxGh3kHQFIdU1xFg-4iTEgNKXncIoy2t-5vI3Oi9rkkkPPtqoWZAcK17h678HwcECGO-PYWs5zWPtJ2biVXQ94Oag6TEQl5R0rzFCg.Sps6DwnwqTR2zWjKtWfwxab9A5Yi0Z2RAbuItbZe7lU&dib_tag=se&keywords=e+ink+display+module&qid=1765311064&s=electronics&sprefix=e+ink+display+module%2Celectronics%2C127&sr=1-8)

### 3-4 hours: I am figureing out what I need to make. 
I think I am going to need
- a E-Paper Connector
- SPI Interface
- buttons for inputs
    -    2 for up and down
    -    one for select
    -    one for back
    -    something that brings up something on the computer it is plugged into
- LEDS LOTS OF LEDS I want it to light up like a christmas tree

I think that this [E-Ink Display](https://www.waveshare.com/product/7.5inch-e-paper-hat-b.htm) would be cheaper and I gain an extra color. I don't know how to make a e ink driver and evreywhere I was looking while reaserching showed that it would probably be more expsenive and waste space.
